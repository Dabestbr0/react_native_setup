HOW TO RUN GUIDE

Go to this link: https://github.com/Dabestbr0/react_native_setup/tree/Bryant_0

This is my repository where I've committed changes to my branch: Bryant_0.

Click on Code button.
Go to local and download the zip file.

Extract the zip file and place it in a directory where you will store all of your React Native projects to code. I would recommend placing it anywhere within your computer's local directory.

Example: C:\Users\<yourusername>\RNprojects

Open the extracted folder in VSCode


Go to terminal, copy and paste all of these packages to install them

npm install @react-navigation/native 

npm install @react-navigation/material-top-tabs

npm install react-native-screens

npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs

npm install react-native-safe-area-context

npm install react-native-screens

npm install react-native-gesture-handler 

npm install react-native-reanimated

npm install react-native-paper

npm install @react-native-community/slider

npm install react-native-sound

expo install expo-location

npm install react-native-pager-view

expo install react-native-maps

expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage @react-native-community/slider @react-navigation/bottom-tabs @react-navigation/material-top-tabs @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack @react-navigation/stack expo expo-av expo-location expo-status-bar firebase react react-native react-native-calendars react-native-gesture-handler react-native-maps react-native-pager-view react-native-paper react-native-reanimated react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens react-native-vector-icons


Next type in 'npm start' to run the app.

Once metro bundler is loaded up, if you did the initial
setup for React Native then all you would need to do is Run Android.

Press the 'a' button to run the android emulator from Android Studio.


If it runs and you get any errors, bugs or whatever that 
React Native gives you, then press the 'r' button to reload and 
after that the app will refresh and it should be working now. 

If you can't run it with android then explore the other options
of Metro Bundler and if they all don't work then let me know.

Thanks
-Bryant
